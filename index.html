                            </ul>
                            <p>As this is an IT role, I wanted to get comfortable with using the ticketing system RT, also known as Request Tracker.
                                This means being able to reply, comment, resolve, merge, and triage incoming tickets.
                                My goal was to interact with at least 10 tickets per week. 
                            </p>
                            <p>Reflection: I was able to exceed my goal of interacting with at least 10 tickets per week. In fact I was able to get up to 15 tickets per week. 
                                Although this was the first time I would be using a ticketing system, thanks to the support of my coworkers I was able to learn it relatively quickly. 
                                This goal also helped me to develop customer service, multi-tasking, and organizational skills. I learned how to respond to clients in a clear and concise manner 
                                and I managed multiple tickets at once. This includes documenting my progress on tickets, informing the client when a request has been completed, or scheduling an appropriate time to meet.

                            <h3 class="mb-0">Machine Deployment</h3>
                            <p>For this goal I wanted to be able to perform tasks independently. This includes imaging devices, as well as downloading software on managed devices for staff, students, and the computer labs</p>
                            <p>Reflection: By the end of my placement I was able to complete this goal. Within the first week of the work term, I had imaged at least 7 laptops, downloaded the neccesary software, and delivered them to the client. 
                            This includes learning how to get into the BIOS, disk partitioning, fixing specific errors, adding devices to their group in Active Directory (AD), etc. 
                            As for downloading software I learned about security levels and permissions, how to use Deepfreeze, how to find the device name without logging in, etc.
                            There were many little details I needed to learn to be able to perform these tasks independently. I made sure to write down anything new that I had learned so that I could reference it in the future.

                            <h3 class="mb-0">Team & Customer Service Communication </h3>
                            <p>My last goal was to be able to cleary communicate with my team and clients.</p>
                            <p>Reflection: At the beginning of the work term I wasn't very good at communication. I would often forget to update my team when I finished a task or would forget to ask basic questions when talking to a client. 
                                What really helped me was writing down reminders on a sticky note. This ensures I don't forget and am prepared for next time. 
                                For example when talking to clients who come to the office, it is good to get their name, email, and role for documentation purposes. That would get hand written in a journal or on a sticky note for future reference.
                                Or if I had completed a task or had any questions, that would get written down too. The sticky note system also just helped with organization in general around the office. 
                                They were used to communicate when a task was done, or what was in a box, where it should go, whether a device had finished imaging or still needed to be moved in Active Directory, etc.
                                In other words, I think the act of documentation really helped improve my overall communication.

                                As said in the Goals section, some of my tasks were to work through tickets from RT, the ticketing system, download software, image devices, and interact with clients.
                                In addition I assisted with AV equipment support, setting up computer labs for the College of Engineering and CCMPS, and helping out with events. 
                                In this role we had weekly meetings to discuss our progress of the tickets for SOE IT Help as well as bi-weekly meetings with the IT from CCMPS.

                    <p>My experience working at the Engineering IT Help Desk was a short but rewarding 4-month work term. 
                        I was able to help solve problems around the college while strengthening my
                        skill set along the way. Whether its improving my customer service skills at the help desk, learning how to use a ticketing system, 
                        or expanding my knowledge on the various ways IT problems are solved, I really enjoyed my
                        time here and look forward to my next coop work term.
